               the creator and principal developer of the Linux kernel,
               which is the kernel for a number 
               of operating systems. He also created the version 
               control system Git. Torvalds was born on<br> 
               December 28, 1969 in Helsinki, Finland. He studied 
               computer science at the University of Helsinki, and 
                      he developed the Linux kernel as a student project in 1991. Since then, 
               the Linux kernel has become one of the most widely used kernels in<br>
